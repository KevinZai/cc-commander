# DevOps Router

> Don't know which DevOps skill to use? Start here. Describe what you need and get routed to the right specialist.

## How It Works

1. Parse the user's request for DevOps signals
2. Match against the intent taxonomy below
3. Recommend 1-3 skills in execution order
4. If ambiguous, ask one clarifying question before routing

| rollback, revert, recover, incident | `infra-runbook` | High |
| feature flag, dark launch, traffic splitting | `zero-downtime-deploy` | Medium |

### CI/CD
| Signal Words | Route To | Confidence |
|-------------|----------|------------|
| pipeline, workflow, github actions, CI/CD | `cicd-pipeline-generator` | High |
